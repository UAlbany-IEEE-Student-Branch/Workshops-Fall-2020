# Workshop 10 - Machine Learning

### Original Description
Workshop Title: Introduction to Machine Learning with neural networks. 

Description: This workshop will focus on giving attendees a ground up introduction to Machine Learning with neural networks. The first hour of the workshop will be a watch along where we will watch and discuss Grant Sanderson's four part Neural networks series. Next we will look at a sample Neural Network implementation solving a simple classification problem using Tensorflow and python. Finally James Oswald will go over his own everyday experience using neural networks for research purposes. 

### Reminder
Just a reminder that tonight at 8 PM we will be hosting the introduction to machine learning with neural networks workshop in the workshop channel, the host being none other than chair of the IEEE UAlbany chapter James Oswald himself! Learn about the interesting world of machine learning as we watch some of Grant Sanderson's (3Blue1Brown on YouTube) videos pertaining to the subject and take a look at James's research pertaining to machine learning. Hope to see you all there!
