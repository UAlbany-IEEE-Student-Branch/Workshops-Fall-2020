# Android Family Tree Part 1

This was a code-along project for our members to learn Android development. In the workshop, participants will learn how to make an app that people can use to document their family tree. Due to the unforseen scope of the project it will be broken up into parts. In this workshop, we implemented some user interface components in the main activity. In the future, we will cover the differences between activities and fragments, how to switch between fragments, how to use an adaptor and list UI component, how to dynamically add and remove items to and from the list, and how to search the list. You can view the portion of the project we completed in the workshop [here](https://github.com/UAlbany-IEEE-Student-Branch/Fall-2020-Workshop-7-App)
